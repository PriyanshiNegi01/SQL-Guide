# SQL and DB Interview QA (Data Scientists)

## Questions & Answers

### Q1: What are joins in SQL and discuss its types?

Answer:

In SQL, a **JOIN** clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. Joins are essential for retrieving data stored across different tables in a relational database.

#### Main Types of Joins:

* **Inner join:** Most common type of join. Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.
* **Left Join:**  Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. Returns `NULL` for right table columns when no match exists.
* **Right Join:** Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. Returns `NULL` for left table columns when no match exists.
* **Full Outer Join:** Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables. Rows without a matching counterpart in the other table will show `NULL` values.

*Note:* MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN directly. Use a `UNION` of a left and right join instead. |

**Extra Point:**  
* **Cross Join:** Returns the Cartesian product of two tables (i.e., every row of table1 joined with every row of table2).  
**Syntax Example:**

```sql
SELECT A.*, B.*
FROM table1 A
CROSS JOIN table2 B;
```

### Q2: Define the primary, foreign, and unique keys and the differences between them?

**Primary key:** Is a key that is used to uniquely identify each row or record in the table, it can be a single column or composite pk that contains more than one column

* The primary key doesn't accept null or repeated values
* The purpose of the primary key is to keep the Entity's integrity
* There is only one PK in each table
* Every row must have a unique primary key

**Foreign key:** Is a key that is used to identify, show or describe the relationship between tuples of two tables. It acts as a cross-reference between tables because it references the primary key of another table, thereby establishing a link between them.

* The purpose of the foreign key is to keep data integrity
* It can contain null values or primary key values

**Unique key:** It's a key that can identify each row in the table as the primary key but it can contain one null value

* Every table can have more than one Unique key

### Q3: What is the difference between BETWEEN and IN operators in SQL?

Answer:

- **BETWEEN Operator:**  
  - **Usage:** Selects values within a specified range.  
  - **Notes:** The range is inclusive (both start and end values are included).  
  - **Example:**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM tablename
    WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 100;
    ```

- **IN Operator:**  
  - **Usage:** Selects rows where a column's value matches any value in a provided list.  
  - **Use Cases:** Best for categorical data but can also work with numeric values.  
  - **Example:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COLUMN
    FROM tablename
    WHERE country IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'UK');
    ```

### Q4: Assume you have the given table below which contains information on user logins. Write a query to obtain the number of reactivated users (Users who did not log in the previous month and then logged in the current month) ###
![Alt_text](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Data-Science-Interview-Questions/blob/main/Figures/Screenshot%202022-07-31%20201033.png)

Answer: 
First, we look at all the users who did not log in during the previous month. To obtain the last month's data, we subtract an ùêàùêçùêìùêÑùêëùêïùêÄùêã of 1 month from the current month's login date. Then, we use ùêñùêáùêÑùêëùêÑ ùêÑùêóùêàùêíùêìùêí against the previous month's interval to check whether there was login in the previous month. Finally, we ùóñùó¢ùó®ùó°ùóß the number of users satisfying this condition.

```
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) AS current_month,
    COUNT(*) AS num_reactivated_users 
FROM 
    user_logins current_month
WHERE
    NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 
        *
      FROM 
        user_logins last_month
      WHERE
        DATE_TRUNC('month', last_month.login_date) BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) AND DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) - INTERVAL '1 month'
)
```

### Q5: Describe the advantages and disadvantages of relational database vs NoSQL databases

Answer:

**Advantages of Relational Databases:** Ensure data integrity through a defined schema and ACID properties.  Easy to get started with and use for small-scale applications. Lends itself well to vertical scaling.  Uses an almost standard query language, making learning or switching between types of relational databases easy.

**Advantages of NoSQL Databases:** Offers more flexibility in data format and representations, which makes working with Unstructured or semistructured data easier.  Hence, useful when still the data schema or adding new features/functionality rapidly like in a startup environment to scale with horizontal scaling.  Lends itself better to applications that need to be highly available. 

**Disadvantages of Relational Databases:** Data schema needs to be known in advance.  Ale schemas is possible, but frequent changes to the schema for large tables can cause performance issues.  Horizontal scaling is relatively difficult, leading to eventual performance bottlenecks

**Disadvantages of NoSQL Databases:** As outlined by the BASE framework, weaker guarantees of data correctness are made due to the soft-state and eventual consistency property.  Managing consistency can also be difficult due to the lack of a predefined schema that's strictly adhered to. Depending on the type of NoSQL database, it can be challenging for the database to handle its types of complex queries or access patterns.

### Q6: Assume you are given the table below on user transactions. Write a query to obtain the third transaction of every user

![1661352126442](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72076328/186479648-5dcbf0a3-46e3-46b4-99ab-94feeace3dca.png)

Answer:
First, we obtain the transaction numbers for each user. We can do this by using the ROW_NUMBER window function, where we PARTITION by the user_id and ORDER by the transaction_date fields, calling the resulting field a transaction number. From there, we can simply take all transactions having a transaction number equal to 3.

### Q7: What do you understand by Self Join? Explain using an example

Answer:

Self-join is as its name implies, joining a table to itself on a database, this process may come in handy in a number of cases, such as:

1- comparing the table's rows to themselves:

It's like we have two copies of the same table and join them together on a given condition to reach the required output query.

Ex. If we have a store database with a client's data table holding a bunch of demographics, we could self-join the client's table to get clients who are located in the same city/made a purchase on the same day/etc.

2- querying a table that has hierarchical data:

Meaning, the table has a primary key that has a one-to-many relationship with another foreign key inside the same table, in other words, the table has data that refers to the same table. We could use self-join in order to have a clear look at the data by matching its keys.

Ex. The organizational structure of a company may contain an employee table that has an employee id and his manager id (who is also an employee, hence has an employee id too) in the same table. Using self-join on this table would allow us to reference every employee directly to his manager.

P.S. we would need to take care of duplicates that may occur and consider them in the conditions.

### Q8: Write an SQL query to join 3 tables
![1668274347333](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72076328/201538710-264494b8-62e7-4e36-8487-be449c1b441a.jpg)

### Q9: Write a SQL query to get the third-highest salary of an employee from `employee_table` and arrange them in descending order.

**Answer:**

To get the third-highest salary from the employee table, we can use the `DENSE_RANK()` or a subquery with `DISTINCT` and `LIMIT/OFFSET`. Here's a method using **subquery with `DISTINCT` and `LIMIT`** (PostgreSQL style):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employee_table
ORDER BY salary DESC
OFFSET 2 ROWS
LIMIT 1;
```
(MySQL style):
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM employee_table 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```

Or using **DENSE_RANK()** (works in SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
    FROM employee_table
) ranked_salaries
WHERE rank = 3;
```

### Q10: What is the difference between Temporary Tables and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)?

| Feature                   | Temporary Tables                            | Common Table Expressions (CTEs)              |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Persistence**          | Persist during the session                  | Exists only during execution of a single query|
| **Reusability**          | Can be used across multiple queries          | Not reusable outside the query                |
| **Storage**              | Stored in the tempdb (disk/memory)          | Stored in memory for the duration of the query|
| **Syntax**               | `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE`                    | `WITH cte_name AS (...)`                      |
| **Use Case**             | Large intermediate data, multiple uses      | Simpler queries, recursion, readable code     |
| **Performance Impact**   | Slightly higher overhead                    | Lightweight, good for quick transformations   |

**CTE Example:**

```sql
WITH Sales_CTE AS (
  SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY salesperson_id
)
SELECT *
FROM Sales_CTE
WHERE total_sales > 100000;
```

**Temporary Table Example:**

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE top_sellers AS
SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY salesperson_id;

SELECT *
FROM top_sellers
WHERE total_sales > 100000;
```

### Q11: Why use Right Join When Left Join can suffice the requirement?

Answer:
In MySQL, the ùó•ùóúùóöùóõùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° ùóÆùóªùó± ùóüùóòùóôùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° are used to retrieve data from multiple tables by joining them based on a specified condition.

Generally, the ùóüùóòùóôùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° is used more frequently than the ùó•ùóúùóöùóõùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° because it returns all the rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, or NULL values if there is no match.

While **LEFT JOIN** is commonly used and can cover many requirements, there are specific scenarios where a **RIGHT JOIN** may be more appropriate:

ùü≠. ùó™ùóµùó≤ùóª ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóΩùóøùó∂ùó∫ùóÆùóøùòÜ ùòÅùóÆùóØùóπùó≤ ùó∂ùòÄ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóøùó∂ùó¥ùóµùòÅ ùòÅùóÆùóØùóπùó≤: If the right table contains the primary data that needs to be retrieved, and the left table contains supplementary data, a ùó•ùóúùóöùóõùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° can be used to retrieve all the data from the right table and matching data from the left table.

ùüÆ. ùó™ùóµùó≤ùóª ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóæùòÇùó≤ùóøùòÜ ùóªùó≤ùó≤ùó±ùòÄ ùòÅùóº ùóØùó≤ ùóºùóΩùòÅùó∂ùó∫ùó∂ùòáùó≤ùó±: In some cases, a ùó•ùóúùóöùóõùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° may be more efficient than a ùóüùóòùóôùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° because the database optimizer can choose the most efficient join order based on the query structure and the available indexes.

ùüØ. ùó™ùóµùó≤ùóª ùòÇùòÄùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóºùòÇùòÅùó≤ùóø ùó∑ùóºùó∂ùóªùòÄ: If the query requires an outer join, a ùó•ùóúùóöùóõùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° may be used to return all the rows from the right table, including those with no matching rows in the left table.

*However, note that many developers prefer LEFT JOIN by simply switching the table order, as it often improves readability.*

### Q12: Why Rank skips sequence?

Answers:
In MySQL, the rank function may skip a sequence of numbers when using the `DENSE_RANK()` function or the `RANK()` function, depending on the data and the query. The `DENSE_RANK()` function assigns a unique rank to each distinct value in a result set, whereas the `RANK()` function assigns the same rank to the duplicate values.

Here are some of the reasons why the rank function may skip a sequence in MySQL:

1. ùóßùóµùó≤ `ùóóùóòùó°ùó¶ùóò_ùó•ùóîùó°ùóû()` function skips ranks when there are ties. For example, if there are two rows with the same values in the ranking column, both will be assigned the same rank, and the next rank will be incremented by 1.

2. ùóßùóµùó≤ `ùó•ùóîùó°ùóû()` function skips ranks when there are gaps between the duplicate values. For example, if there are three rows with the same values in the ranking column, and then the next row has a higher value, the `RANK()` function will skip over the fourth rank.

3. The query may have filtering or grouping clauses that affect the ranking. For example, if a query filters out some rows or groups them by a different column, the ranking may not be sequential.

It's important to note that the ranking function in MySQL behaves differently from the ranking function in other databases, so the same query may produce different results in different database systems.











## SQL and DB Interview QA (Data Scientists)


### Q1: What are Joins in SQL and Discuss Its Types?

**Answer:**  

### Q2: Define the Primary, Foreign, and Unique Keys and the Differences Between Them

**Answer:**

- **Primary Key:**  
  - **Definition:** A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table.  
  - **Characteristics:**  
    - Cannot contain `NULL` values.  
    - Must contain unique values only.  
    - There is only one primary key per table (which can be composite).  
  - **Usage:** Helps maintain **entity integrity**.

- **Foreign Key:**  
  - **Definition:** A foreign key is a column or a set of columns used to establish and enforce a link between the data in two tables.  
  - **Characteristics:**  
    - References a primary key (or unique key) in another table.  
    - Can contain `NULL` values if the relationship is optional.  
  - **Usage:** Maintains **referential integrity**.

- **Unique Key:**  
  - **Definition:** A unique key constrains values so that no duplicates exist in a column (or group of columns), similar to a primary key.  
  - **Differences from Primary Key:**  
    - A table can have multiple unique keys.  
    - Unique keys can allow one `NULL` (depending on the DBMS).  

**Comparison Table:**

| Key Type      | Uniqueness       | NULLs Allowed | Number Allowed      | Purpose                          |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Primary Key   | Must be unique   | No            | One per table       | Unique row identification        |
| Foreign Key   | May have duplicates; must match primary/unique key | Yes (if optional) | Multiple per table (pointing to one or more tables) | Establish relationships between tables |
| Unique Key    | Must be unique   | Generally one allowed (varies by DBMS) | Multiple per table    | Enforce uniqueness in columns    |

### Q3: What is the Difference Between the BETWEEN and IN Operators in SQL?

**Answer:**  


**Visual Tip:**  
Using a diagram (as shown in your screenshot) often helps interviewers see that **BETWEEN** provides a range filter while **IN** works by listing specific values.

---

### Q4: Write a Query to Obtain the Number of Reactivated Users

**Scenario:** Users who did not log in the previous month but logged in during the current month.  
**Assumption:** You have a table (`user_logins`) containing login records.

**Answer:**  

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) AS current_month,
    COUNT(*) AS num_reactivated_users 
FROM 
    user_logins current_month
WHERE
    NOT EXISTS (
        SELECT 1
        FROM user_logins last_month
        WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', last_month.login_date) = DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) - INTERVAL '1 month'
          AND last_month.user_id = current_month.user_id
    )
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date);
```

**Enhancements:**  
- Ensure that you also match on `user_id` so that you‚Äôre comparing the same users.
- **Note:** The syntax for date functions (such as `DATE_TRUNC`) may vary between systems.

### Q6: Write a Query to Obtain the Third Transaction of Every User

**Answer:**  
To pick the third transaction per user, you can use the **ROW_NUMBER()** window function:

```sql
SELECT user_id, transaction_date, amount
FROM (
    SELECT 
        user_id, 
        transaction_date, 
        amount,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS txn_num
    FROM user_transactions
) sub
WHERE txn_num = 3;
```

**Explanation:**  
- **ROW_NUMBER()** numbers transactions per user.
- The inner query partitions by `user_id` and orders by `transaction_date`.
- The outer query filters transactions where the row number equals 3.

### Q7: What is a Self Join? Explain Using an Example

**Answer:**  
A **Self Join** is a regular join in which a table is joined with itself. This is useful when comparing rows within the same table.

#### Example 1: Comparing Rows Within the Same Table

Suppose you have a table, `employees`, with columns `employee_id`, `name`, and `department`. To find pairs of employees in the same department, you can write:

```sql
SELECT A.name AS Employee1, B.name AS Employee2, A.department
FROM employees A
JOIN employees B ON A.department = B.department
WHERE A.employee_id <> B.employee_id;
```

#### Example 2: Hierarchical Data

In an employee table where each employee may have a manager (stored as `manager_id` which references `employee_id`), a self join can help retrieve an employee‚Äôs manager name:

```sql
SELECT E.name AS Employee, M.name AS Manager
FROM employees E
LEFT JOIN employees M ON E.manager_id = M.employee_id;
```

---

### Q8: Write an SQL Query to Join 3 Tables

**Answer:**  
Assume you have three tables: `orders`, `customers`, and `products`.  
A typical join might look like:

```sql
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    c.customer_name,
    p.product_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
```

**Explanation:**  
- This query joins `orders` to `customers` using `customer_id` and then joins the result to `products` using `product_id`.

---

### Q9: Write a SQL Query to Get the Third-Highest Salary from `employee_table` and Arrange Them in Descending Order

**Answer:**  

#### **MySQL Approach Using LIMIT/OFFSET:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM employee_table 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```

**Explanation:**  
- `ORDER BY salary DESC` sorts all salaries in descending order.
- `DISTINCT` ensures you remove duplicates (if multiple employees have the same salary).
- `LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2` skips the two highest distinct salaries and returns the next one (third highest).

#### **Alternative Using Window Functions (MySQL 8.0+):**

```sql
SELECT employee_id, salary
FROM (
    SELECT 
        employee_id,
        salary,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
    FROM employee_table
) ranked_employees
WHERE salary_rank = 3;
```

**Explanation:**  
- This query uses **DENSE_RANK()** to assign ranks based on the salary.
- Then, it filters out the rows where the rank is 3.

### Q10: What is the Difference Between Temporary Tables and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)?

**Answer:**

| Feature            | Temporary Tables                                           | Common Table Expressions (CTEs)                    |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Physically created tables that exist for the duration of a session or until explicitly dropped.  | Virtual tables defined within the scope of a single SQL statement. |
| **Persistence**    | Persist until the session ends or are manually dropped.    | Exist only during the execution of the query.       |
| **Storage**        | Stored on disk (in the system‚Äôs temporary space).          | Exist in memory for the life of the query execution. |
| **Reusability**    | Can be reused across multiple queries (in the same session). | Only available to the single query that defines them.|
| **Syntax**         | `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE table_name AS ...`                 | `WITH cte_name AS (...)`                           |
| **Use Cases**      | Suitable for storing large intermediate results to be used multiple times.  | Best for simplifying complex queries by breaking them into logical building blocks. |

**CTE Example:**

```sql
WITH Sales_CTE AS (
  SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY salesperson_id
)
SELECT *
FROM Sales_CTE
WHERE total_sales > 100000;
```

**Temporary Table Example:**

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE top_sellers AS
SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY salesperson_id;

SELECT *
FROM top_sellers
WHERE total_sales > 100000;
```

### Q11: Why Use RIGHT JOIN When LEFT JOIN Can Suffice the Requirement?


---

### Q12: Why Might the SQL Rank Function Skip a Sequence?

**Answer:**  
When using ranking functions, such as `RANK()` or `DENSE_RANK()`, you may see non-sequential rank values for the following reasons:

1. **Ties in Data:**  
   - With `RANK()`, if multiple rows have the same value, they receive the same rank. The next distinct value receives a rank with a gap.  
   - **Example:** If two rows rank as 1, the next row will be ranked 3.
   
2. **Using `DENSE_RANK()`:**  
   - `DENSE_RANK()` does not create gaps after ties; however, using both functions in similar queries can create differing sequences depending on the requirement.

3. **Filtering or Grouping Effects:**  
   - Changes in the dataset due to filtering or grouping may cause unexpected discontinuities in the rank sequence as the ranking resets with each partition.

**Tip:**  
Always consider which ranking function best suits your needs when ties are expected in your dataset.

---

### Additional Question (Q13): What are Indexes and How Do They Improve Query Performance?

**Answer:**  
- **Indexes** are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - **Improved Read Performance:** Significantly reduces the amount of data scanned during searches.
  - **Faster Sorting and Filtering:** Speeds up order by and WHERE clauses.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - **Insert/Update Overhead:** Additional storage space and slower write operations due to index maintenance.
  - **Complexity:** Too many indexes can degrade performance.

**Syntax Example (Creating an Index):**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_salary
ON employee_table (salary);
```
