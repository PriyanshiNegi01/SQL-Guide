# SQL and DB Interview QA (Data Scientists)

## Questions & Answers

### Q1: What are joins in SQL and discuss its types?

Answer:

In SQL, a **JOIN** clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them. Joins are essential for retrieving data stored across different tables in a relational database.

#### Main Types of Joins:

* **Inner join:** Most common type of join. Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.
* **Left Join:**  Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. Returns `NULL` for right table columns when no match exists.
* **Right Join:** Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. Returns `NULL` for left table columns when no match exists.
* **Full Outer Join:** Returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables. Rows without a matching counterpart in the other table will show `NULL` values.

*Note:* MySQL does not support FULL OUTER JOIN directly. Use a `UNION` of a left and right join instead. |

**Extra Point:**  
* **Cross Join:** Returns the Cartesian product of two tables (i.e., every row of table1 joined with every row of table2).  
**Syntax Example:**

```sql
SELECT A.*, B.*
FROM table1 A
CROSS JOIN table2 B;
```

### Q2: Define the primary, foreign, and unique keys and the differences between them?

Answer:

- **Primary Key:**  
  - **Definition:** A primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table.  
  - **Characteristics:**  
    - Cannot contain `NULL` values.  
    - Must contain unique values only.  
    - There is only one primary key per table (which can be composite).  
  - **Usage:** Helps maintain **entity integrity**.

- **Foreign Key:**  
  - **Definition:** A foreign key is a column or a set of columns used to establish and enforce a link/relationship between the data in two tables.  
  - **Characteristics:**  
    - References a primary key (or unique key) in another table.  
    - Can contain `NULL` values if the relationship is optional.  
  - **Usage:** Maintains **referential integrity**.

- **Unique Key:**  
  - **Definition:** A unique key constrains values so that no duplicates exist in a column (or group of columns), similar to a primary key.  
  - **Differences from Primary Key:**  
    - A table can have multiple unique keys.  
    - Unique keys can allow one `NULL` (depending on the DBMS).  

**Comparison Table:**

| Key Type      | Uniqueness       | NULLs Allowed | Number Allowed      | Purpose                          |
|---------------|------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| Primary Key   | Must be unique   | No            | One per table       | Unique row identification        |
| Foreign Key   | May have duplicates; must match primary/unique key | Yes (if optional) | Multiple per table (pointing to one or more tables) | Establish relationships between tables |
| Unique Key    | Must be unique   | Generally one allowed (varies by DBMS) | Multiple per table    | Enforce uniqueness in columns    |

### Q3: What is the difference between BETWEEN and IN operators in SQL?

Answer:

- **BETWEEN Operator:**  
  - **Usage:** Selects values within a specified range.  
  - **Notes:** The range is inclusive (both start and end values are included).  
  - **Example:**

    ```sql
    SELECT *
    FROM tablename
    WHERE price BETWEEN 10 AND 100;
    ```

- **IN Operator:**  
  - **Usage:** Selects rows where a column's value matches any value in a provided list.  
  - **Use Cases:** Best for categorical data but can also work with numeric values.  
  - **Example:**

    ```sql
    SELECT COLUMN
    FROM tablename
    WHERE country IN ('USA', 'Canada', 'UK');
    ```

### Q4: Assume you have the given table below which contains information on user logins. Write a query to obtain the number of reactivated users (Users who did not log in the previous month and then logged in the current month) ###
![Alt_text](https://github.com/youssefHosni/Data-Science-Interview-Questions/blob/main/Figures/Screenshot%202022-07-31%20201033.png)

Answer: 

First, we look at all the users who did not log in during the previous month. To obtain the last month's data, we subtract an ùêàùêçùêìùêÑùêëùêïùêÄùêã of 1 month from the current month's login date. Then, we use ùêñùêáùêÑùêëùêÑ ùêÑùêóùêàùêíùêìùêí against the previous month's interval to check whether there was login in the previous month. Finally, we ùóñùó¢ùó®ùó°ùóß the number of users satisfying this condition.

```
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) AS current_month,
    COUNT(*) AS num_reactivated_users 
FROM 
    user_logins current_month
WHERE
    NOT EXISTS (
      SELECT 
        *
      FROM 
        user_logins last_month
      WHERE
        DATE_TRUNC('month', last_month.login_date) BETWEEN DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) AND DATE_TRUNC('month', current_month.login_date) - INTERVAL '1 month'
)
```

### Q6: Assume you are given the table below on user transactions. Write a query to obtain the third transaction of every user

![1661352126442](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72076328/186479648-5dcbf0a3-46e3-46b4-99ab-94feeace3dca.png)

Answer:
First, we obtain the transaction numbers for each user. We can do this by using the ROW_NUMBER window function, where we PARTITION by the user_id and ORDER by the transaction_date fields, calling the resulting field a transaction number. From there, we can simply take all transactions having a transaction number equal to 3.
![1661352088335](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72076328/186479695-5d2b7f36-5703-489d-87e3-6bad6ee1a9b7.jpg)

To pick the third transaction per user, you can use the **ROW_NUMBER()** window function:

```sql
SELECT user_id, transaction_date, amount
FROM (
    SELECT 
        user_id, 
        transaction_date, 
        amount,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date) AS txn_num
    FROM user_transactions
) sub
WHERE txn_num = 3;
```

**Explanation:**  
- **ROW_NUMBER()** numbers transactions per user.
- The inner query partitions by `user_id` and orders by `transaction_date`.
- The outer query filters transactions where the row number equals 3.

### Q7: What do you understand by Self Join? Explain using an example

Answer:

A **Self Join** is a regular join in which a table is joined with itself. This is useful when comparing rows within the same table.

#### Example 1: Comparing Rows Within the Same Table

Suppose you have a table, `employees`, with columns `employee_id`, `name`, and `department`. To find pairs of employees in the same department, you can write:

```sql
SELECT A.name AS Employee1, B.name AS Employee2, A.department
FROM employees A
JOIN employees B ON A.department = B.department
WHERE A.employee_id <> B.employee_id;
```

#### Example 2: Hierarchical Data

In an employee table where each employee may have a manager (stored as `manager_id` which references `employee_id`), a self join can help retrieve an employee‚Äôs manager name:

```sql
SELECT E.name AS Employee, M.name AS Manager
FROM employees E
LEFT JOIN employees M ON E.manager_id = M.employee_id;
```

P.S. we would need to take care of duplicates that may occur and consider them in the conditions.

### Q8: Write an SQL query to join 3 tables

Answer:

Assume you have three tables: `orders`, `customers`, and `products`.  
A typical join might look like:

```sql
SELECT 
    o.order_id,
    c.customer_name,
    p.product_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id;
```

**Explanation:**  
- This query joins `orders` to `customers` using `customer_id` and then joins the result to `products` using `product_id`.

### Q9: Write a SQL query to get the third-highest salary of an employee from `employee_table` and arrange them in descending order.

**Answer:**

To get the third-highest salary from the employee table, we can use the `DENSE_RANK()` or a subquery with `DISTINCT` and `LIMIT/OFFSET`. Here's a method using **subquery with `DISTINCT` and `LIMIT`** (PostgreSQL style):

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employee_table
ORDER BY salary DESC
OFFSET 2 ROWS
LIMIT 1;
```
(MySQL style):
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT salary 
FROM employee_table 
ORDER BY salary DESC 
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;
```

Or using **DENSE_RANK()** (works in SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT *,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
    FROM employee_table
) ranked_salaries
WHERE rank = 3;
```

### Q10: What is the difference between Temporary Tables and Common Table Expressions (CTEs)?

| Feature                   | Temporary Tables                            | Common Table Expressions (CTEs)              |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**     | Physically created tables that exist for the duration of a session or until explicitly dropped.  | Virtual tables defined within the scope of a single SQL statement. |
| **Persistence**          | Persist during the session                  | Exists only during execution of a single query|
| **Reusability**          | Can be used across multiple queries          | Not reusable outside the query                |
| **Storage**              | Stored in the tempdb (disk/memory)          | Stored in memory for the duration of the query|
| **Syntax**               | `CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE`                    | `WITH cte_name AS (...)`                      |
| **Use Case**             | Large intermediate data, multiple uses      | Simpler queries, recursion, readable code     |
| **Performance Impact**   | Slightly higher overhead                    | Lightweight, good for quick transformations   |

**CTE Example:**

```sql
WITH Sales_CTE AS (
  SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY salesperson_id
)
SELECT *
FROM Sales_CTE
WHERE total_sales > 100000;
```

**Temporary Table Example:**

```sql
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE top_sellers AS
SELECT salesperson_id, SUM(sales) AS total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY salesperson_id;

SELECT *
FROM top_sellers
WHERE total_sales > 100000;
```

### Q11: Why use Right Join When Left Join can suffice the requirement?

Answer:
In MySQL, the ùó•ùóúùóöùóõùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° ùóÆùóªùó± ùóüùóòùóôùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° are used to retrieve data from multiple tables by joining them based on a specified condition.

Generally, the ùóüùóòùóôùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° is used more frequently than the ùó•ùóúùóöùóõùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° because it returns all the rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, or NULL values if there is no match.

While **LEFT JOIN** is commonly used and can cover many requirements, there are specific scenarios where a **RIGHT JOIN** may be more appropriate:

ùü≠. ùó™ùóµùó≤ùóª ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóΩùóøùó∂ùó∫ùóÆùóøùòÜ ùòÅùóÆùóØùóπùó≤ ùó∂ùòÄ ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóøùó∂ùó¥ùóµùòÅ ùòÅùóÆùóØùóπùó≤: If the right table contains the primary data that needs to be retrieved, and the left table contains supplementary data, a ùó•ùóúùóöùóõùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° can be used to retrieve all the data from the right table and matching data from the left table.

ùüÆ. ùó™ùóµùó≤ùóª ùòÅùóµùó≤ ùóæùòÇùó≤ùóøùòÜ ùóªùó≤ùó≤ùó±ùòÄ ùòÅùóº ùóØùó≤ ùóºùóΩùòÅùó∂ùó∫ùó∂ùòáùó≤ùó±: In some cases, a ùó•ùóúùóöùóõùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° may be more efficient than a ùóüùóòùóôùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° because the database optimizer can choose the most efficient join order based on the query structure and the available indexes.

ùüØ. ùó™ùóµùó≤ùóª ùòÇùòÄùó∂ùóªùó¥ ùóºùòÇùòÅùó≤ùóø ùó∑ùóºùó∂ùóªùòÄ: If the query requires an outer join, a ùó•ùóúùóöùóõùóß ùóùùó¢ùóúùó° may be used to return all the rows from the right table, including those with no matching rows in the left table.

*However, note that many developers prefer LEFT JOIN by simply switching the table order, as it often improves readability.*

### Q12: Why Rank skips sequence?

Answers:

When using ranking functions, such as `RANK()` or `DENSE_RANK()`, you may see non-sequential rank values for the following reasons:

1. **Ties in Data:**  
   - With `RANK()`, if multiple rows have the same value, they receive the same rank. The next distinct value receives a rank with a gap.  
   - **Example:** If two rows rank as 1, the next row will be ranked 3.
   
2. **Using `DENSE_RANK()`:**  
   - `DENSE_RANK()` does not create gaps after ties; however, using both functions in similar queries can create differing sequences depending on the requirement.

3. **Filtering or Grouping Effects:**  
   - Changes in the dataset due to filtering or grouping may cause unexpected discontinuities in the rank sequence as the ranking resets with each partition.

**Tip:**  
Always consider which ranking function best suits your needs when ties are expected in your dataset.

### Q13: What are Indexes and How Do They Improve Query Performance?

Answer:

- **Indexes** are special lookup tables that the database search engine can use to speed up data retrieval.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - **Improved Read Performance:** Significantly reduces the amount of data scanned during searches.
  - **Faster Sorting and Filtering:** Speeds up order by and WHERE clauses.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - **Insert/Update Overhead:** Additional storage space and slower write operations due to index maintenance.
  - **Complexity:** Too many indexes can degrade performance.

**Syntax Example (Creating an Index):**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_salary
ON employee_table (salary);
```
